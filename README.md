## How does it work
<!-- What we have to do to make it work/run -->
* i personnaly use the port 47 for my app, you can obviously change it if you want
* the "sql database" folder contains the data (ðŸ˜…), all you need is to import it into a "qimgumot" database already created by you (i used wamp to manage it)
* Node.js, of course have to be installed
* the project include already the nodes modules required
* just have to be in the project directory and the "node app.js" command should run the app
* then go to your browser and enter the right url: "localhost:47" (47 in my case, if you have change your port number your url have to be different)
* if you want to stop the app just type "ctrl + c" in the command line
